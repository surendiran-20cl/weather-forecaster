## Introduction

The Weather Forecaster project is developed as a simple and interactive Java application to enable users to access weather forecasts in their desired location. The user-friendly graphical interface allows users to input a location, retrieve weather data, and view forecasts for the next few days. The project is designed to be easily expandable and customizable, making it an excellent learning resource for Java developers and enthusiasts.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface
- Real-time weather data retrieval
- Forecast data for the next 3-5 days
- Support for various locations worldwide
- Integration with an external weather API

## Installation

To set up the Weather Forecaster project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/surendiran-20cl/weather-forecaster.git
```

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans).

3. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Launch the application from your IDE or by running the main class (`WeatherForecasterApp.java`).

2. The graphical interface will appear, prompting you to enter the desired location.

3. After providing the location, click the "Get Forecast" button.

4. The application will fetch real-time weather data from the external API and display the current conditions and the forecast for the next few days.

5. You can also customize the application to add additional features or improve its functionality as you see fit.

## API Key

This project relies on data from an external weather API to provide accurate forecasts. You will need to obtain an API key from the API provider and insert it into the `WeatherApiService.java` file. Make sure to follow the API provider's terms of use.

```java
// WeatherApiService.java

private static final String API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
```
